# A Free Udacity Course that compares Angular and Ember

### 1. Features of Single page apps
* A typical single page front end application has
    * HTML Chunks
    * DOM manipulations
    * data processings
    * handle user interactions
* server side vs client side apps
     * server side app would have mostly constant data rendered at front end like blogs and contract form
     * client side app would have dynamic data like email client, searchable map and stock ticker
     * identifying the type of the app helps us to know the cost of the refresh of the single page app.  


* Angular JS Framework:
    * In a nutshell has  
            * Module : encloses the other components
            * template : holds the view part of the web page
            * scope : determines the connection between controller and template and passes it **bidirectionally**
            * controller: passes the required data for templates
            * router: interacts with multiple controller for managing the interrelated data  between controllers.
