# Node.js self study ( edureka, medium, quora, twitter etc )
* You start with ```npm init``` in a directory  where you intend your app server (backend app) development.
  * this would create ```package.json``` with user input description of the app and other details
    * this file is cruicial for containerization of the app for cloud or any deployment.
    * this step is equivalent to creating a new virtual environment in anaconda prompt for a new app development. It would help to have specified version of the package for the app without disturbing the other app packages version in other environments.
    * the **package.json** file is distantly equivanet to **requirements.txt** file in case of python development.
  * do ```npm install``` for the required packages to be used in the app
    * this is equivalent to ```pip install``` in python environment.
    * here each install automatically makes an entry into **package.json** dependency key.
