##### Angular JS described in the Udacity free course is 1.x and hence starting new note. Trying to read from The Webpage and other open sources


* Angular JS requires Node.js. 
     * Now, what is Node.js ? https://www.toptal.com/nodejs/why-the-hell-would-i-use-node-js
     * Why I need NodeJS: https://www.angularjswiki.com/angular/is-node-js-required-for-angular-2-or-angular/
          * we need to conver the typescript to javascript and angular packages are npm (node package manager) dependent.
          * The article talk about How single threaded node js is faster than java (multi threaded). It simply creates a pool of tasks and runs one by one. Here the assumption is each request asynchronous and non blocking in nature. So like bullets in gun loaded and fired, one after the other.
